  This paper presents the results of a production experiment examining the acoustic correlates of word stress in Lithuanian, a language which also exhibits lexical tone contrasts. Analysis of the data indicates that duration and intensity are reliably perceptible markers of stress (consistent with previous impressionistic descriptions), but vowel quality (as measured by F1 and F2) is not. Pitch (F0) data collected in the study are ambiguous between stress correlate and categorical tonal target, and are therefore inconclusive. Data from more speakers is therefore necessary to disambiguate the two possibilities.

# Background
The purpose of the current study is to answer the question: "What is stress in a tone/pitch accent language?" Convergence of metrical structure and lexical tone on a single language poses a relevant question for phonetic implementation: given that perturbation in fundamental frequency (F0) is a correlate of tone \textit{and} of stress (see @Gordon_Roettger17 for a cross-linguistic survey of stress correlates), which acoustic properties will stress utilize in a language which also contrasts for tone?

To address this question, a production study was performed to examine the acoustic correlates of stress in Lithuanian, a language which is reported to exhibit both word stress and lexical pitch accent(tone), as well as an interaction between tone and stress (see @Blevins93, @deLacy02 and numerous references cited therein). Impressionistic descriptions of stress in the language include increases in duration, loudness, and pitch, as well as qualitative changes in vowels, with tonal contrasts being neutralized in unstressed position (see @Ambrazas97, @Girdenis03, and @Young91). 

Disagreement exists in the literature regarding the tonal inventory of the language. Generative accounts posit a three-way tonal distinction: falling (\textit{acute}) and rising (\textit{circumflex}) pitch accents realized on syllables with long vowels, diphthongs or sonorant codas, and a shorter falling (\textit{grave}) pitch accent on syllables with short vowels or obstruent codas (@Kenstowicz72, @deLacy02). Structuralist descriptions of the language (@Mathiassen96, @Ambrazas97, @Girdenis03) maintain that since grave syllables are not contrastive, they do not constitute proper pitch accents, and are merely the realization of word stress. To establish an acoustic profile of stress, and in an attempt to maximally disambiguate stress from tone, the experiment limited its focus to grave syllables.

# Methods
This section outlines the details of the production experiment from which acoustic data were gathered, describes data processing procedures, and identifies the framework for statistical analysis.

## Participants
Data from four native speakers of Lithuanian was collected, of which one was used for analysis in the current study. Information about the speaker was gathered via a demographic questionnaire instrument which the participant completed before beginning the experiment. This speaker (male, mid 30s) was born in Lithuania and acquired the language as his L1 during childhood, moving to the United States after reaching adulthood. His primary home language continues to be Lithuanian, which he speaks daily with his spouse (also an L1 Lithuanian speaker) and children (heritage speakers). This suggests a low possibility of L1 attrition. Additionally, the subject was naïve to the purpose of the study, was not trained in linguistics, and had no history of speech impairment.

## Target Stimuli
Multiple segmental and prosodic controls were implemented during selection of target stimuli (n = 60), which were limited to nominal forms (roots+inflectional suffixes). The primary control limited targets to a specific syllabic structure and default stress placement: trisyllabic words of the shape [CVCVCV(C)] and tetrasyllabic words of the shape [CVCVCVCV(C)], with default stress on the penult. Potential targets with complex onsets in any position (pre-tonic, tonic, post-tonic) were excluded. Additionally, target selection minimized root syllables containing codas [CVC] or lacking onsets [V]. Due to lexical gaps, however, two target roots were selected which contained these suboptimal structures: \textit{apetit}- ‘apetite’ and \textit{mygtuk}- ‘button’.

Syllables containing the short vowels [u] and [i] were given preference in selection (n = 32 and 28, respectively), as these vowels are not reported to undergo phonological lengthening in stressed position, an effect reported for the vowels [a] and [e] (@Kenstowicz72, @Ambrazas97, @Girdenis03).

Segmental environment on the vowel in the stressed syllable was also controlled. Grave syllable vowels were flanked by either stops [k, t, p]--and to a lesser extent [g] and [d]--(n = 36) or sonorants [l, m, n] (n = 24). Again, the prevalence of lexical gaps prevented controlling for either stop or sonorant segments exclusively, so segmental environment was coded as a variable in statistical analysis.

Targets conforming to the above restrictions were further limited to roots of the same declension class (Ia) and accent class (2) to ensure uniformity of accentual properties across stimuli (see @Ambrazas97 for more discussion). Four suffixes from this declension class were selected to combine with nominal roots based on predicted stress placement: two suffixes (nominative singular [-as] and genitive singular [-o]) for which stress is predicted to surface on the default root position, and two suffixes (locative singular [-e] and accusative plural [-us]) for which stress is predicted to surface on the suffix (also known as a *stress mobility* effect; see @Blevins93, @Dogil99, @Ambrazas97, @Girdenis03, @Mathiassen96, and @Young91 for more discussion).


## Scenario/Frame Sentences
Target words were placed within two frame sentences designed to illicit vernacular speech production. Participants were asked to imagine themselves in an informal conversation with a friend in a restaurant or bar setting. The subject notices that someone has scrawled a word on the wall next to them, making an observation about the strange appearance of the handwriting. Subjects read each target word in both frame sentences, provided in (1).

\newpage
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex\label{ex1a}
\glll \v{Z}iurek, \v{c}ia para\v{s}ytas \v{z}odis [target]. \\
\textipa{ZuRek} \textipa{\t{tS}a} \textipa{p\super haRaSi:tas} \textipa{Zodis} {} \\

word {} write.\textsc{pass} strange \\
\glt `The word [target] is written strangely.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Designing a scenario which focuses on a written word in the ambient environment allowed the frame sentences to accommodate any word equally well, regardless of its declension. The target word appears sentence-finally in the first frame sentence and sentence-medially in the second frame. To control for any confounds related to phrase-final lengthening (@Wightmanetal92), frame sentence was coded as a variable in the statiscial models.


## Procedure
Recording took place inside a sound-attenuated booth at the Phonology and Field Research Laboratory at Rutgers University. The subject wore an AKG C420 head-worn microphone with behind-the-neck headband to maintain constant distance from the mouth. Sound recordings were made with GoldWave v6.10 software at 44.1k Hz sampling rate and 16-bit quantizing resolution in mono. Experiment prompt images were projected onto a laptop screen inside the recording booth. The images portrayed a scene with non-descript characters dining in a restaurant/bar setting, one of which is shown pointing to a word in strange handwriting in the ambient environment. The same word appeared at the top left-hand corner of the screen in standard orthography, as shown in \textit{Figure 1}.

Frame sentences were printed on a separate sheet of paper for the participant's reference. The subject read the word in both frame sentences, then pressed a key to advance to the next picture. Three repetitions of the stimuli (situated within both frame sentences) were recorded. Target order was randomized and counterbalanced in each repetition, with filler words evenly spaced among stimuli. Five additional fillers were placed at the beginning of each repetition to accommodate any initial hyper- or mis-articulation in case the participant felt anxious about the task. All three repetitions were completed during a single session with a 10-to-15 minute break between each repetition.


## Exclusions
60 target words were produced within 2 frame sentences across 3 repetitions, totaling 360 individual productions of stimuli. Of these, 12 productions (6 target productions across 2 frame sentences) were excluded from analysis due to stuttering or excessive pausing. These include 4 target productions from the first repetition, 2 from the second repetition, and 6 from the third repetition.


## Hypotheses
The current study tests the following hypotheses (2), which are based on traditional descriptions of the acoustic realization of word stress in Lithuanian.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textit{Experiment Hypotheses}\
\begin{xlist}
\ex\label{ex1a} Hypothesis 1: Duration of vowels in stressed syllables is \textbf{longer} than in unstressed syllables \
\ex\label{ex1b} Hypothesis 2: Intensity of vowels in stressed syllables is \textbf{greater} than in unstressed syllables \
\ex\label{ex1c} Hypothesis 3: Vowels in stressed syllables are \textbf{more peripheralized} (as measured by F1 and F2) than in unstressed syllables \
\ex\label{1d} Hypothesis 4: Pitch (as measured by F0) in stressed syllables is \textbf{higher} than in unstressed syllables
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

## Data Processing
After data collection concluded, sound files were annotated using TextGrids in Praat (@Praat). Boundaries were marked for all vowels within target words as well as fixed intervals in both frame sentences for the purpose of duration normalization. Left edges were identified by placing a boundary at the zero crossing of the first periodic, non-deformed waveform of the vowel (@Francisetal02). The right edges of vowels were determined by inserting a boundary at the end of the vowel's second formant (@Turketal06).

TextGrid intervals were marked to indicate a) the vowel, b) predicted stress pattern based on traditional accounts, c) position within the word or frame sentence, and d) number of syllables of the target word. File names were coded to indicate the repetition (A = 1st repetition, B = 2nd repetition, C = 3rd repetition). These factors formed the basis for the fixed and random effects structure of the statistical analysis.

Duration data were extracted using boundary marks on TextGrids for each audio file. A normalization multiplier was created by dividing the raw duration of the marked fixed interval in each frame sentence by the mean of all fixed intervals. This yielded 128 target repetition- and frame sentence-specific multipliers. TextGrid intervals for vowels in each target word in a given frame sentence were multiplied by the corresponding multiplier, yielding a normalized value. Intensity, F1, F2, and F0 data were collected using a modified Praat script based on @Lennes03. Vowel midpoint values were extracted for each acoustic parameter to ensure measurement of the most stable portion of the vowel. Two datapoints for the vowel [u] failed to return F0 measurements, and were discarded.

A subset of the data were isolated for analysis. This includes [u] and [i] vowels in penultimate position on nominals. Traditional descriptions predict stress to fall on the root when combining with nominative singular and genitive singular suffixes, and on the suffix when combining with locative singular and accusative plural suffixes. This allows for direct comparison of the acoustic properties of vowels which are predicted to be in both stressed and unstressed positions. An example is given in (3) of the root *ratuk-* 'wheel', with the syllable containing the relevant vowel in bold.

\begin{exe}

\ex\label{ex1b} ra.\textbf{tu}.\textipa{"}kus `wheel \textsc{AccPl}' (stress predicted on suffix)
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

## Statistical Analysis
A series of linear mixed effects models were fit to the data using the *lmer()* function in the lme4 package (@R-lme4) in R (@R-base). For each vowel, five separate models were fit. Acoustic parameter (normalized duration, intensity, F1, F2, and F0) was set as the criterion, with four categorial variables set as predictors: predicted stress (stressed and unstressed), frame sentence (1st frame sentence and 2nd frame sentence), segmental environment of the vowel (obstruents and sonorants), and syllable count of the word (three syllables and four syllables). The random effects structure for each model specified by-word random slopes for segmental environment, frame sentence, and repetition.

To test for the effect of predicted stress (as described in traditional accounts) on the acoustic realization of each parameter, nested models were created for each of the five models which excluded the predicted stress predictor. Corresponding models were then compared via a Likelihood Ratio Test using R's *anova()* function, yielding a p-value. Experiment-wise alpha was set at 0.05.

All models converged with full specification, and visual inspection of residual plots for the normalized duration, intensity, F1, and F2 models did not indicate any violation of homoskedasticity or normality. The F0 models did, however, violate this assumption. This will be explored in further detail in the Discussion section.

# Results
This section presents the results of the experiment. Results of each acoustic correlate (normalized duration, intensity, F1/F2, F0) are presented separately.

## Normalized Duration
Mean values of normalized duration and standard deviation show variation as a function of predicted stress. Stressed syllables were longer in duration than unstressed syllables, and this generalization was true for both [u] and [i], as shown in \textit{Figure 2}.

```{r Figure2, fig.cap="Mean Normalized Duration in ms by Predicted Stress (N=unstressed, Y=stressed), [u] and [i]", warning=FALSE}
durplot
```

Specifically, [u] vowels in stressed position exhibited a mean normalized duration of 57.5 ms (13.0 ms s.d.), with unstressed vowels approximately 12ms shorter (mean normalized duration of 45.6 ms and 10.8 ms s.d.). This effect was observed across frame sentences and for both three- and four-syllable words (see \textit{Table 1}). Model comparison with linear mixed effects models fit to the data confirmed the effect of predicted stress on the normalized duration of [u] ($\chi^2(1) = 33.163, p < 0.05$). Predicted stress on [u] vowels corresponds with an estimated duration increase of 11.62 ms +/- 3.51 ms (standard error). 

```{r Table1, fig.cap="Normalized Duration by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [u] vowel", warning = FALSE}
udur %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "Normalized Duration in ms by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [u] Vowel")
```

Difference in mean normalized duration for [i] vowels between stressed (62.8 ms, 13.5 ms s.d.) and unstressed (47.9 ms, 12.7 ms s.d.) syllables collapsed across other categories was approximately 14.9 ms. Mean values grouped by frame sentence and by-word syllable count are shown in \textit{Table 2}. Predicted stress was determined to be a significant effect for these values as a result of model comparison ($\chi^2(1) = 28.298, p < 0.05$). Stress on syllables with a [i] nucleus correlated with a 12.85 ms increase in normalized duration +/- 2.26 ms (standard error).  

```{r Table2, fig.cap="Normalized Duration by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [i] vowel", warning = FALSE}
idur %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "Normalized Duration in ms by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [i] Vowel")
```

## Intensity
Intensity values extracted from vowel midpoints tended toward higher mean intensity for vowels on stressed syllables and lower mean intensity for vowels on unstressed syllables. \textit{Figure 2} illustrates this trend for both [u] and [i] vowels. 

```{r Figure3, fig.cap="Mean Intensity in dB by Predicted Stress (N=unstressed, Y=stressed), [u] and [i]", warning=FALSE}
intplot
```

Across frame sentence and syllable count, stressed and unstressed [u] displayed a mean intensity difference of approximately 3 dB (74.5 dB (2.44 dB s.d.) and 71.4 dB (3.13 dB s.d.), respectively). These mean estimates remained stable for intensity measurements on [u] vowels in both frame sentences and within three- and four-syllable words, as shown in \textit{Table 3}. Model comparison yielded an effect of predicted stress on the intensity parameter for the [u] vowel ($\chi^2(1) = 58.289, p < 0.05$), such that stress on [u] indicates an estimated intensity increase of 3.27 dB +/- 0.37 dB (standard error).

```{r Table3, fig.cap="Intensity by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [u] vowel", warning = FALSE}
uint %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "Intensity in dB by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [u] Vowel")
```

Similar results were observed for [i]. Intensity values for this vowel closely mirror the [u] vowel data, with a corresponding 3 dB gap between mean intensity values on stressed (74.5 dB (2.55 dB s.d.)) and unstressed (17.5 dB (2.79 dB s.d.)) syllables. Comparison of the intensity models fit to the [i] vowel data yielded a main effect of predicted stress ($\chi^2(1) = 39.409, p < 0.05$). Again, these results were almost identical to the [u] vowel data; word stress correlates with an estimated 3.28 dB (+/- 0.47 dB standard error) increase in intensity on [i] vowels. 

```{r Table4, fig.cap="Intensity by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [i] vowel", warning = FALSE}
iint %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "Intensity in dB by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [i] Vowel")
```


## F1 and F2
In general, reliability of vowel quality (measured in F1 and F2) as an acoustic correlate of stress would predict discrepancies between F1 and F2 depending on the vowel. In the case of the high, back vowel [u], centralization of an unstressed vowel corresponds to relatively higher F1 and higher F2. Centralization of the high, front vowel [i], by contrast, is realized with higher F1 and lower F2. Peripheralization of a stressed vowel would predict the inverse (lower F1/lower F2 for [u]; lower F1/higher F2 for [i]).

Turning to the extracted vowel quality data, little variation was observed for [u] in stressed and unstressed syllables for either mean F1 or mean F2. F1 values were almost identical (416 Hz (68.7 Hz s.d.) in unstressed syllables; 413 Hz (67.3 Hz s.d.) in stressed syllables), while F2 values were higher for unstressed syllables (1247 Hz (362 Hz s.d.)) than stressed syllables (1091 Hz (342 Hz s.d.)). Grouping by frame sentence and by-word syllable count (\textit{Table 5}), however, reveals substantial overlap between F1 and F2 figures in stressed and unstressed environments. A vowel plot for stressed and unstressed [u] in trisyllabic words in \textit{Figure 4} illustrates this overlap; in the figure, vowels marked "u2" and "u5" represent [u] vowels in unstressed syllables in the first and second frame sentence, respectively, while "U2" and "U5" indicate vowels in stressed syllables in the first and second frame sentence, respectively.


```{r Table5, fig.cap="F1 and F2 by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [u] vowel", warning = FALSE}
uvow %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "F1 and F2 in Hz by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [u] Vowel")
```

```{r Figure4, fig.cap="F1/F2 Plot, [u] Vowel (Trisyllabic Words)", warning=FALSE}
vowelplot_u_3
```

Separate sets of linear mixed effects models were fit to the F1 and F2 data for [u]. Nested model comparison did not identify predicted stress as a main effect for either F1 ($\chi^2(1) = 1.59, p = 0.2062$) or F2 ($\chi^2(1) = 2.7143, p = 0.0995$).

Mean F1 and F2 values remained mostly uniform across stressed and unstressed syllables containing a [i] nucleus. Less than a 10 Hz mean change was observed for F1 (unstressed: 369 Hz (35.5 Hz s.d.); stressed: 376 Hz (32.3 Hz s.d.)), and mean F2 values varied by less than 100 Hz (unstressed: 1621 Hz (228 Hz s.d.); stressed: 1696 Hz (183 Hz s.d.)). The range of values for both parameters are spread evenly across [i] vowels in each frame sentence and for three- and four-syllable words (see \textit{Table 6}). \textit{Figure 5} demonstrates the homogeneity of the vowel quality data with a vowel plot of trisyllabic words containing a [i] nucleus; substantial intersection in the vowel space of stressed and unstressed syllables is evident (the same labeling schema from \textit{Figure 4} holds). 

```{r Table6, fig.cap="F1 and F2 by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [i] vowel", warning = FALSE}
ivow %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "F1 and F2 in Hz by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [i] Vowel")
```

```{r Figure5, fig.cap="F1/F2 Plot, [i] Vowel (Trisyllabic Words)", warning=FALSE}
vowelplot_i_3
```

Surprisingly, nested model comparison of the F1 models on [i] revealed that vowel quality does vary as a function of predicted stress ($\chi^2(1) = 4.127, p = 0.0422$), such that F1 on [i] vowels in stressed syllables increases by an estimated 11.19 Hz +/- 5.2 Hz (standard error). The same effect was not observed for F2 ($\chi^2(1) = 0.7222, p = 0.3954$).

## F0

\textit{Figure 6} plots mean F0 values for [u] and [i] vowels across stressed and unstressed syllables. The general trend is toward higher F0 on stressed syllables, and lower F0 on unstressed syllables.

```{r Figure6, fig.cap="Mean F0 in Hz by Predicted Stress (N=unstressed, Y=stressed), [u] and [i]", warning=FALSE}
f0plot
```

Examining mean figures for all [u] vowels, variation in F0 as a function of stress was approximately 46 Hz (unstressed: 113 Hz (9.49 Hz s.d.); stressed: 159 Hz (25.1 Hz s.d.)). This tendency is mostly uniform across [u] vowels in both frame sentences and within three- and four-syllable words (see \textit{Table 7}). Comparison of the linear mixed effects models fit to the data indicated a main effect of predicted stress ($\chi^2(1) = 121.1, p < 0.05$); stress on the vowel raises F0 by an estimated 43.029 Hz +/- 2.71 Hz (standard error).

```{r Table7, fig.cap="F0 by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [u] vowel", warning = FALSE}
uF0 %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "F0 in Hz by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [u] Vowel")
```

Similar effects were observed for [i] vowels, whose mean F0 values varied approximately 39 Hz across stressed and unstressed syllables (unstressed: 108 Hz (9.46 Hz s.d.); stressed: 147 Hz (20 Hz s.d.)). \textit{Table 8} illustrates that this variation is sustained in both frame sentences and across words of varying lengths. Additionally, model comparison identified predicted stress as a main effect ($\chi^2(1) = 88.482, p < 0.05$) such that [i] vowels on stressed syllables correlate with an increase in F0 of approximately 36.349 Hz +/- 2.733 Hz (standard error).


```{r Table8, fig.cap="F0 by Stress, Frame, and Syllable Count, [i] vowel", warning = FALSE}
iF0 %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = 'latex', digits = 2, caption = "F0 in Hz by Predicted Stress (Stress), Frame Sentence (Frame), and Syllable Count (Syllnum), [i] Vowel")
```

# Discussion
The current study examined five acoustic measures which have been claimed to signal word stress in Lithuanian: normalized duration, intensity, F1, F2, and F0.

Analysis of the normalized duration results confirms Hypothesis 1. [u] and [i] vowels on syllables predicted to be stressed were longer than those in unstressed syllables by an estimated 11.62 ms and 12.85 ms, respectively. Not only was this difference found to be significant, but it is also likely to be perceptible to hearers. Assuming even a conservative Just-Noticeable-Difference for duration of 20% (@Klatt76), the parameter estimates yielded by duration models for both vowels surpass this perceptibility threshold. Therefore, duration is a reliable acoustic correlate of stress on [u] and [i] vowels for this speaker.

Intensity results, similarly, confirm Hypothesis 2. For both vowels, greater intensity was observed in stressed syllables than in unstressed syllables. Model comparison revealed a main effect of predicted stress such that vowels on stressed syllables are produced with an intensity level 3 dB greater than unstressed syllables. Again, this difference is perceptible to hearers (@Harris63), indicating that intensity reliably marks stress on [u] and [i] in the speech of the experiment participant.

The vowel quality data as a whole fail to confirm Hypothesis 3. Stressed vowels did not show evidence of peripheralization compared to vowels in unstressed syllables. A main effect of stress on the realization of F1 was found for the vowel [i]; however, this increase in F1 as a function of stress represents a lowering of [i] in the vowel space, which is the *opposite* of what the hypothesis would predict for that vowel. Furthermore, the 11 Hz parameter estimate for the model is negligible. Given these facts, vowel quality (measured by F1 and F2) is demonstrably unreliable as an acoustic correlate of word stress for the experiment participant. This result contradicts previous accounts of the phonetic realization of stress in Lithuanian.

F0 data indicate that stress correlates with higher pitch for both [u] and [i]. Model comparison revealed a main effect of predicted stress on the realization of F0, and the predicted increases were comparable for each vowel. This suggests evidence in support of Hypothesis 4.

```{r Figure7, fig.cap="Heteroskedastic residuals for F0 LME model, [u] vowel", warning=FALSE}
plot(fitted(u.F0.model), residuals(u.F0.model))
```

In evaluating the reliability of these models, however, it was discovered that residuals for both [u] and [i] F0 models violated homoskedasticity, as shown in \textit{Figure7} and \textit{Figure 8}. Two distinct distributional regions are clear from these residual plots. New models were fit to the data using a log-transformed F0 predictor in an attempt to mitigate this effect. Nested model comparisons for these models revealed a main effect of predicted stress, much like for the unstransformed F0 models. Again, however, visual inspection of residuals determined a violation of the homoskedasticity assumption.

```{r Figure8, fig.cap="Heteroskedastic residuals for F0 LME model, [i] vowel", warning=FALSE}
plot(fitted(i.F0.model), residuals(i.F0.model))
```

At least two explanations are possible for this result. One is that there exists another variable (or variables) unaccounted for in the models beyond frame sentence, segmental environment, number of syllables, and repetition. Another possibility assumes Generative analyses of grave syllables--that is, that they bear tone--and that F0 is realizing a categorical tonal distinction (between a [H] target and a [L] target or default toneless target; recall that tonal distinctions are neutralized in unstressed position). Under this assumption, the expectation of a bimodal distribution of the F0 data is reasonable, with local maxima corresponding to [H] and [L] (or default toneless) targets. Histograms of the F0 data for both [u] and [i] (\textit{Figure 9} and \textit{Figure 10}) are inconclusive, however; F0 values in stressed and unstressed syllables appear to congregate around local maxima, but with a substantial degree of overlap, particularly for [i]. Data from additional native speakers will be necessary to determine the nature and robustness of this effect.

```{r Figure9, fig.cap="Histogram of F0 Values Separated by Stress, [u] Vowel", warning=FALSE}

```

```{r Figure10, fig.cap="Histogram of F0 Values Separated by Stress, [i] Vowel", warning=FALSE}

```

To assess the cumulative reliability of the separate linear mixed effects models for acoustic parameter, a logistic regression model was fit to each vowel (using the *glmer()* function in lme4). Predicted stress (categorical variable with two levels: stressed and unstressed) was set as the criterion, with the five acoustic correlates as continuous predictors (normalized duration, intensity, F1, F2, F0). Acoustic data were rescaled using the *scale()* function. Models for both vowels failed to converge with a fully-specified random effects structure, that is, by-word random slopes for frame sentence, segmental environment, number of syllables in the word, as well as repetition. A majority of the possible minimally-specified permutations of these effects also failed to reach convergence. For [u], two models converged: one specifying by-word random slopes for repetition, and one for frame sentence. Three models converged for [i]: one specifying by-word random slopes for repetition, one for frame, and one which included both. For all five models, intercepts were uncorrelated in the random effects structure.

The logistic regression models on [u] indicate a main effect of F0 (repetition model: $\beta = 7.028, \, se = 2.056, \ z=3.149, \, p<0.05$; frame sentence model: $\beta = 7.5989, \, se = 2.3196, \ z=3.276, \, p<0.05$), but only a marginally-significant effect of normalized duration (repetition model: $\beta = 0.9959, \, se = 0.5251, \ z=1.897, \, p = 0.058$; frame sentence model: $\beta = 0.991, \, se = .5283, \ z=1.875, \, p=0.061$). No main effects were observed for intensity, F1, or F2. 

The three models fit to [i] data revealed main effects of both F0 and normalized duration (see \textit{Table 9}). No effects were observed for intensity, F1, or F2.

These results are mostly consistent with the linear mixed effects models in that duration and pitch are reliable predictors of predicted stressed position, while vowel quality is not. The one exception is intensity. This discrepancy may be due to the effect of variable rescaling; the 3 dB difference estimated by the linear effects models (determined to be significant and perceptible to hearers) may have been minimized during rescaling to allow for comparison with other values measured in milliseconds and Hertz. Another unfortunate tradeoff for model convergence was the thinning of the random effects structure, potentially impacting the accuracy of the logistic regression models. A larger data set (with multiple speakers) may rectify this issue, allowing for more complete random effects specification. 

# Conclusion
This study has addressed the question "What is stress in a tone language?" by examining the acoustic correlates of stress on grave syllables in Lithuanian nominals. The results of a production study partially confirmed previous accounts of stress in the language: stressed syllables are marked by longer duration and greater intensity on vowels, but not by changes in vowel quality. Vowels on stressed syllables were realized with higher F0, but it is unclear whether this is an acoustic correlate of stress or a lexical tonal contrast. A larger dataset will provide a frame of reference in confirming the effects observed in this study.
